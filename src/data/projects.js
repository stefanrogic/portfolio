This helped developing the application quickly and efficiently, while ensuring a consistent user interface across all pages.",
      "For navigation I used React Router DOM to define routes for different pages such as the job listing page and job details page. For example, when a user clicks on a job listing, React Router DOM navigates the user to the job details page for that listing.",
      "In addition to React, I also used Sass as a CSS preprocessor for the project. Sass allowed modular and maintainable CSS code by introducing several new features such as variables, nesting, and mixins. This made it easier to style the application and ensure a consistent look and feel across all pages.",
      "Overall, the Dev Jobs web application project demonstrates my skills in developing modern web applications using popular frontend technologies as well as my ability to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces, write maintainable and scalable code, and implement efficient styling using Sass.",
